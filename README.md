# YouTube Data Analysis

This project delves into YouTube data, aiming to uncover trends, understand various metrics, and potentially identify informative patterns. 

## What You'll Find

- **Jupyter Notebook**: [`YouTube_Data_Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/Dilruba05/YouTube_Data_Analysis/blob/main/YouTube_Data_Analysis.ipynb) - The core analysis script containing Python code for data loading, exploration, visualization, and potential modeling.

## Project Goal

Analyze YouTube data to gain insights into video performance, channel growth, and viewer engagement over time.

## Possible Coding Approach

### Data Loading and Exploration

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Use `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
   - Utilize `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

2. **Load the Data**:
   - Load the YouTube data into a DataFrame.
   - Explore the data to understand the available features (views, likes, comments, etc.) and their timeframes.

3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Use descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
   - Visualize data distributions and trends over time using histograms, line plots, and bar charts.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (if necessary)

1. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Identify and address missing values (e.g., impute or remove rows/columns).

2. **Data Consistency**:
   - Ensure data consistency and handle outliers or inconsistencies (if applicable).

### Data Analysis and Visualization

1. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Analyze video performance over time using time series plots.
   - Investigate viewer engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Explore relationships between different metrics (e.g., views and likes, likes and comments).

3. **Category Analysis**:
   - Analyze the performance of different video categories.

### Results and Discussion

1. **Summarize Findings**:
   - Highlight key findings from the analysis, including interesting trends or relationships discovered in the data.

2. **Impact Discussion**:
   - Discuss the potential impacts based on your findings (e.g., on content strategy, viewer engagement).

3. **Acknowledge Limitations**:
   - Discuss any limitations of your analysis, such as data availability or chosen methodology.

## Expected Final Results

- A well-structured Jupyter notebook documenting the data exploration, analysis, and visualization process.
- Informative data visualizations that reveal trends and insights about the YouTube data.
- A deeper understanding of how data analysis can be used to study YouTube metrics and improve channel performance.
